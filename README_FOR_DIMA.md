# video_test_02
test between OS

Hey Dima, thanks for looking at this!

Option 1 which works on iOS is the works_on_ios.html file running the works_on_ios.js script

Option 2 which works on both iOS and Android (OS v4.0) is the works_on_android.html file which references a CDN of video.js

Let me know what you think
